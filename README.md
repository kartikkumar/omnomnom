# onnomnom
Lejos codebase for on-nom-nom robot built using Lego Mindstorms NXT during robotics workshop at International Space University (ISU) Space Studies Program 2016 (SSP16).

The script is able to avoid obstacles, stay within prescribed bounds and find its way back to the starting point.

# Requirements
- [LejOS](http://www.lejos.org/ "LeJOS - Java for Lego Mindstorms")

# Build
Execute the [build.sh] script to minify main file, compile and link. Next, execute the following command to upload to your NXT brick (must be connected and be on):

    nxjupload OnNomNom.java

# Files
- [OnNomNomFull.java](https://github.com/kartikkumar/onnomnom/blob/master/OnNomNomFull.java): file containing all functionality; input parameters are defined in this file.
- [build.sh](https://github.com/kartikkumar/onnomnom/blob/master/build.sh): bash script that will minify, build and link code.
- [OnNomNom.java](https://github.com/kartikkumar/onnomnom/blob/master/OnNomNomFull.java): minified file (auto-generated by build script).
